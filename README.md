# Rule-Based Classification

## Business Problem

A game company using some features of its customers
It wants to create level-based new customer definitions (personas) and to create segments according to these new customer definitions and to estimate how much the new customers can earn on average according to these segments.


- ✨E.g:
    It is desired to determine how much a 25-year-old male user from Turkey, who is an IOS user, can earn on average. ✨

## Dataset Story

- Persona.csv dataset contains the prices of the products sold by an international game company and some demographic information of the users who buy these products.
- The data set consists of records created in each sales transaction.
- This means that the table is not deduplicated.
- In other words, a user with certain demographic characteristics may have made more than one purchase.
